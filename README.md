# IBM-DATA-SCIENCE-PROFESSIONAL-CERTIFICATE-MATERIALS-AND-CODE
This repository contains all the coding materials and notebooks I used and studied while taking the courses for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. Some might be missing, but I think I ave gathered most of them. I have also provided the solutions to the practice questions.
ALL FINAL ASSIGNMENTS TO COURCES CONTAIN ORIGINAL WORK AND ARE *NOT* TO BE COPIED!
